The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the database rules are incorrectly configured or if the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the data.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in the application. For example, attempting to read data that the user does not have access to may result in a permission denied error.  Another common problem is handling asynchronous operations, where a data update might not complete before the application tries to use the updated data, leading to stale data errors.
